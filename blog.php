            <h2>Reflections/Analysis - Alex</h2>
            <p>I certainly have learned alot from building the site as part of a
                creative project for an Apocalypticism in Film course. It was the
                second website I’ve helped design from the ground up, so I certainly
                improved upon my web dev skills in a great manner, and I’m happy with
                how it turned out visually.</p>
            <p>With regards to content, the main thesis 
                that my partner Jay and I focused on is the seeming growing obsession 
                with any and all things apocalyptic that has emerged in popular culture
                during the twenty-first century. Across many different forms of media, 
                we are seeing an increase of the output of apocalyptic related products.
                This is a result of many contributing factors, but the one I want to hone
                in on for this analysis segment is the Mayan Calendar and all the 2012
                Apocalypse conspiracy theories.</p> 
            <p>The ancient Mayan civilization created a very accurate calendar 
                for their time, which happened to end on the Winter Solstice of 
                the year 2012. People started asking the question why, and before
                we knew it there were a million different theories about how the 
                Mayans had predicted the end of the world, which is why their calendar
                stopped. Popular culture became obsessed with this idea of the Mayan 
                Apocalypse, which is a major factor to why we see many emerging forms 
                of apocalyptic themed media starting in the 21st century, when these
                conspiracy theories really started coming to light.</p>
            <p>Articles for and against the apocalypse suddenly started flooding our news feeds, and 
                films like “2012” made us filled our minds with anxiety as we all started
                to wonder: is anything really going to happen on December 21st, 2012? 
                Of course, that day is long gone, and we were all fools to worry at all.
                But just because the Mayan Apocalypse has faded doesn’t mean humanity’s 
                thirst for it’s own demise has subsided at all.</p>
            <p>The zombie craze 
                has arguably been at an all time high in the past several years. 
                With recent film releases like World War Z, Elysium, and Divergent,
                it seems like every new BlockBuster film has a plot that deals with 
                the end of the world and recovering in a post-apocalyptic setting. 
                The apocalyptic craze is showing no signs of slowing down and it will 
                be fascinating to observe where it goes in the near future.</p>
