            <h2>Pikmin Series</h2>
            <p>The Pikmin series is a unique take on the classic apocalyptic video game.
            The player takes control of Captain Olimar, who crash lands on a distant foreign planet.
            He must work with the nearly extinct native Pikmin species to fix his spacecraft
            and return home. Saving the Pikmin from extinction by fighting
            against the indigenous predator species is a very enjoyable experience. 
            The Pikmin series is a very lighthearted and fun approach
            on the apocalyptic theme. </p>

            <h2>Left 4 Dead</h2>
            <p>One of the more well known zombie apocalyptic video game series,
            Left 4 Dead's winning formula comprises of four players working together
            to survive the oncoming horde. Amongst the common zombies in the horde
            are special mutated zombies that are much more dangerous and require
            teamwork to take down. The second installment in this franchise 
            builds upon the success of the first and allows the player to
            use melee weapons to slay zombies. Left 4 Dead suggests above all else
            that good teamwork and communication are needed to survive the 
            zombie apocalypse.</p>

            <h2>Half-Life 2</h2>
            <p>The critically acclaimed Half-Life 2 is a masterpiece in the
            post-apocalyptic video game genre. It's a first person shooter where
            the player can affect everything from the physical environment to the behaviors
            of friends and enemies around them. The world is slowly dying out from
            an alien infestation. Resources are rapidly being depleted and 
            humanity's numbers are growing thing. Half-Life 2 is the story of a 
            research scientist's quest for survival in the apocalyptic world. 
            The storytelling and action are
            excellently designed, and playing the game is a wonderful experience one
            won't soon forget.</p>
