            <h1>The Apocalypse in Gaming</h1>
            <p>It is clear that in our culture and society apocalyptic settings
                and themes are a popular genre found in many games such as the 
                Fallout series, Half-Life 2 and Resident Evil. Many of these games
                allow the player to be the hero that is going to save the world
                or at least make a difference in the world through helping or 
                hurting others. The popularity of these games show just positively
                Apocalyptic themes are received by the general community. As a
                result this popularity often extends into different forms of media
                based on the games. For instance there are many novels and films 
                based off games with apocalyptic settings. Because apocalypticism 
                is a global theme, audiences internationally can connect with the 
                plotlines or story no matter how drastically different the culture
                portrayed in games are. While many of the games are American made
                and feature American culture, games with apocalyptic themes are
                renown internationally with players from Asia, Africa, and Europe.
                Thus it allows the world to become closer as a community through
                their similarities in gaming preferences etc.</p>
            
            <h2>Fallout Series</h2>
            <p>
                Receiving international acclaim and establishing itself as one of the most popular
                and best selling rpg’s, the Fallout series represents a perfect example of apocalypticism
                in video games. Taking place in an apocalyptic wasteland, players must navigate
                the wasteland in order to complete their missions. In the process they must gather 
                supplies in order to survive and learn survival skills such as how to use weapons
                and negotiate with raiders. The setting and theme of the game is extremely dark
                and often times players are forced to choose between doing a good thing such as 
                saving a town or destroying it and thus profiting from the action. The setting 
                of each game in the series is similar to the scenes in the Book of Eli however 
                unlike the film there are many small settlements and factions that have established 
                control over certain areas of the wasteland. The initial release of the first
                Fallout game in 1997 illustrates how even as the video game industry was just 
                emerging, themes of apocalypticism were already becoming a well established genre.</p>

            <h2>Pikmin Series</h2>
            <p>One of the most unique and classic apocalyptic video games is the
                Pikmin series. While it appears to be light hearted and fun, 
                players must aid a nearly extinct species of Pikmin with their
                character Captain Olimar after crash landing on a distant planet.
                Throughout the game Olimar fights against the indigenous predator
                species while working on repairing his ship in order to return home.
                While many games in apocalyptic genres are darker themed with more 
                intense action, the Pikmin series shows how the genre has been 
                twisted to encompass various settings and scenarios. </p>

                all else that good teamwork and communication are needed to survive

                slow moving zombies thus portraying how even today the zombie
