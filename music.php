            <h1>The Apocalypse in Music</h1>
            <p>Music is a personal retreat. It's a place to store one's happy memories,
            and a place to record one's deepest fears and regrets. Humans seem to have
            an easier time signing about things that trouble them than talking about it
            outright. Looking past the melodies and catchy tunes of many familiar songs,
            an examination of the lyrics reveals many different apocalyptic themes.</p> 
            
            <p>There apocalyptic-in-nature song lyrics often times deal with an 
            extraordinary fear or having to cope with an immense personal loss.
            Other times the lyrics revolve around humanity's innate destructive
            nature. The obvious question emerges: what feeds our desire to sing about
            death and destruction, and why are we so attracted to these such songs?</p>
            
            <p>We listen to music for many reasons: for enjoyment, to decompress,
            to relax, etc. We find something we can relate to in the music that 
            we choose to listen to. The emotion of the musicians also plays a 
            part in our attraction to music. Many popular songs draw immense emotion 
            from the vocalists. We as an audience can feel the passion in the 
            tone of voice and sound of the instruments. Apocalyptic-themed songs
            that deal with loss and destruction naturally are going to be very
            emotionally intensive. It follows then that we feel attracted
            to these types of songs because we can relate to them; we feel
            and understand what the singer is going through.</p>
            
            <p>We develop a connection to the singer and the song when we 
            can strongly relate with the lyrics and emotion. We gravitate towards
            songs about the apocalypse because the music conveys our emotional
            feelings towards such an event happening, even though we try to avoid
            such an apocalypse in our everyday lives. Nothing tells a sad story 
            quite like a song does. That being said, there are many different types
            of apocalyptic-themed music, just as there are many different genres of 
            music itself. Here are three playlists containing 
            a variety of apocalyptic songs in different musical styles.</p>
