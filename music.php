            <h1>It's All About the End</h1>
            <p>The manner in which people musically express the end of the world
            speaks a great deal about their fears and how they view humanity as a whole. 
            Sometimes it's about the fear of losing a loved one, or
            the fear of an extraterrestrial invasion. Other times it's
            about the idea that humanity innately wants to destroy itself. 
            Whatever the case may be, these fears or theories are certainly  
            be easy to sing about, but they certainly are easy to relate to 
            as listeners. Perhaps that is why we gravitate towards many
            of these popular songs. It is why we relate so
            well to many of these lyrics. We as humans seem to feed on the fear 
            of others, knowing that we aren't the only ones that experience 
            these phobias. That is something to keep in mind while enjoying 
            the following apocalyptic tunes. The following songs are
            divided into three playlists to cater to a variety of musical
            genres and listening styles.</p>
            <h2>End of the World Hits</h2>
            <p>Not all songs about armageddon have to be gloomy and foreboding.
                Check out this top hits playlist including appearances from popular artists such as
                Imagine Dragons, Janelle Monae, and Linkin Park!</p>

            <h2>High Octane Apocalypse</h2>
            <p>This playlist is perfect for those who are willing to face the end of the 
                world head on and without fear. The aggressive tones and dark lyrics 
                remind us of the true destructive nature of the apocalypse.

            <h2>VGM/Instrumental Apocalyptic Mix</h2>
            <p>Just because a song doesn't have words doesn't mean it can't be
                about the apocalypse! Varying tones can create a dramatic effect,
                implying a dire or out-of-this-world situation. 
                Beats by Daft Punk, Chrono Trigger, The Prodigy, and more!</p>
